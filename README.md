# Analysis-of-sorting-algorithms
Analysis and implementation of Insertion, Merge and Quick sort along with a hybrid Quick-Insertion sort combination.

The implementation of the sorting algorithms is included. Along with a function `performanceAnalysis(int size)` that 
takes size of array that it creats for the tests. The results of the tests are then presented according to the following 
output showing the time elapsed in milliseconds, the number of key comparisons and the number of moves.

For execution, use the `make` command to call `Makefile` and run `main()`.
